# AUXI

The goal here is to create a **"platform"** that pairs people (aka neighbours) offering and needing help as we go through this pandemic..

* Getting groceries
* Help in setting up digital communication tools to stay connected to relatives
* Striking a phone conversation to help with loneliness
* Go out for a walk - whilst keeping a safe distance of course 

*Note: this process is rough and a work in progress, please free to contribute ideas, approaches, and of course offers and requests :)*

Many thanks to the Opensourcedesign.net Jobs folks for creating their Jobs repo, giving us a great head start.
